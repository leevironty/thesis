# Table of contents
- Introduction
    - Intro: time table optimization and why good time tables matter in a very high level
    - Literature review
        - Describing the problem setting: TimPass & PESP models
        - NN / ML methods in public transport planning
        - NN methods with MIPs
    - Problem setting
        - Benefit of using heuristics for TimPass
        - NN as a heuristic: describing the idea
        - Stating what we will study:
            - Does the NN heuristic beat shortest path routing? (this better be true)
            - If yes, how does training with smaller problem instances generalize to larger problems?
            - Multiple kinds of larger problems: larger ptn, more od pairs, more lines etc.
            - How the solution quality affects this? As in, can we use suboptimal samples that still have better gap than the trivial heuristic?
            - If not possible to use NN heuristic, why so? How could these problems be overcome (or just overcome and then the answer is yes)
    - Introduce the overall structure of the thesis: descriptions for data, models results etc.
- Public transport data
    - EANs
        - How eans look like, what we have going on there
    - Benchmarks
        - Mention timpasslib, briefly describe what we have there and how hard the problems are.
    - Training data generation process
        - Single ptn
        - Random lines, line count between 2 and 4
        - Random line frequencies, weighted by line count
        - All od pairs, random demands
        - Solved with TimPass
            - OBS! How does multiple valid solutions affect all of this? Maybe we should somehow include this fact in the training process????
    - Represenation as a heterogenous graph
        - All edge features turned to a node with node features and a bunch of edges
        - No numerical ids, instead connected to nodes representing that id
- NN methods
    - Intro to NNs
        - Briefly describe how NN models work: lots of multiplication and additions, loss, backpropagation for parameter updates
    - HGT
        - Used with graph data, graph data will be described later
        - Architecture in detail
            - Also mention positional encodings and batch norms
        - Why HGT and not some other architecture?
            - Benefits from heterogenous graph data
            - Modern, good performance on benchmarks
            - Message passing may allow us to scale this to larger problems without impossible memory requirements
    - Training
        - Hyperparameter tuning
        - Mention triton
- Experiments
    - Trying to beat the trivial heuristic
        - How this is measured?
            - Using generated test data
            - Measuring both loss and objective gap to optimal solution
    - Generalization
        - Bigger problems, same measurement methods as for the other experiment
- Results
    - Pretty plots and tables of the obtained losses and gaps
- Summary, conclusions
    - ...
